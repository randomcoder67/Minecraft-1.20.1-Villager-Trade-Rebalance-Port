# Minecraft Villager Trade Rebalance 1.20.1 Port

Mojang released an experimental villager trade rebalance as part of the 1.20.2 update. Unfortunately it is therefore not avalible on 1.20.1, which is the most popular 1.20 version for modding. This repo contains a port of (most) of the features of the trade rebalance.

## Features

Contains most of the features listed in [the wiki article](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Villager_Trade_Rebalance):
* Increased diamond ore spawning in the deepslate layers
* Modification to structure loot tables to make certain enchanted books more common
* Changes to Librarian trades
* Changes to Armourer trades

I haven't added the cartographer trades for the villager maps, not sure if that can be done with a simple datapack.  
I also didn't port the Wandering Trader changes, because who uses the Wandering Trader?

I also modified the trades for the Weaponsmith and the Toolsmith in a similar way to the Armourer changes.

## Dependencies

This datapack is designed to work with a Fabric mod

* [VillagerConfig](https://modrinth.com/mod/villagerconfig)
* [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)


## Installation

Download the two zip files and drag them into the datapacks screen when generating a world
